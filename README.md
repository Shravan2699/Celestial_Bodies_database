# Universe Database

## Overview

Welcome to the Universe Database! This project focuses on the creation and management of a database that simulates a universe, complete with galaxies, planets, moons, stars, and satellites. The goal is to provide a structured and scalable solution for storing information about celestial bodies and their relationships within the cosmos.


## Key Features

1. **Database Creation:**
   - The script creates a new PostgreSQL database named "universe" with default settings.

2. **Table Structure:**
   - Five main tables are defined: `galaxy`, `planet`, `moon`, `star`, and `satellite`.

3. **Data Insertion:**
   - Sample data is included, offering insights into galaxies, moons, planets, satellites, and stars.

4. **Sequences:**
   - Sequences are established for unique identifier generation (`galaxy_id`, `moon_id`, `planet_id`, `satellite_id`, `star_id`).

5. **Constraints:**
   - Primary and unique key constraints ensure data integrity.

6. **Foreign Keys:**
   - Relationships between tables are defined through foreign key constraints.
